<v Ross Medico>This is a test for Samuel Nelson Crosby. Speaking for my gaming headset. I'm just going to speak a bunch of gibberish for a few moments to see if this transcript of service will be able to identify what I'm saying and assign it to who I am

00:00:14.640 --> 0:00:23.050
or assignment to see if a different person is speaking such as, say, Dr Person, we'll have speak in 321

00:00:24.000 --> 0:00:25.800
<v Dr. James Person> In June 1946

00:00:26.840 --> 0:00:36.560
Kim Il Sung, the head of the North Korean Communist Party and pack Anyang, the head of the South Korean Communist Party, traveled to Moscow, where they met with Joseph Stalin.

00:00:37.340 --> 0:00:41.870
The purpose of the trip was to ask for assistance for Korean Communist activities

00:00:42.640 --> 0:00:46.450
or to ask for assistance for Communist activities in Korea.

00:00:48.040 --> 0:00:54.760
<v Ross Medico> This is Ross again. I just wanted to speak more gibberish to see if it will now identified me. I speaking instead of Dr Person.

00:00:55.440 --> 0:01:05.150
Well, my name is Ross. So please identify me and yeah, kph, I is awesome. But it is even more awesome. Is Samuel Nelson Crosby.

00:01:05.740 --> 0:01:09.550
Samuel Crosby is a interesting individual.

00:01:10.440 --> 0:01:14.970
He was born at the top of Mount Rainier by two tigers. Um,

00:01:15.840 --> 0:01:23.550

00:01:25.850 --> 0:01:27.050
<v Dr. James Person> In their meeting with Stalin,

00:01:28.040 --> 0:01:38.770
they asked for, uh, material before they asked for material assistance and for equipment to help in in Communist propaganda and agitation initiatives.

00:01:39.940 --> 0:01:40.570
All right,

00:01:41.640 --> 0:01:46.410
little is known, or little was known of this meeting for a long time,

00:01:46.940 --> 0:01:50.360
<v Ross Medico>and that was the conclusion of our test. I hope that was helpful, Samuel.
